     <h1>COMM 2204- Introduction to Textiles</h1>
     <h2>Dr. Chen-Yu</h2>
     <p>Introduction to Textiles is required by the Fashion Merchandising & Design curriculum. This has been my most challening class, as we must learn about many textiles and evaluate them. We discuss how each textile is created, treated, and cleaned, and we analyze swatches to determine fiber content.</p>
     <p>Dr. Chen-Yu is an Associate Professor in the Department of Apparel, Housing, and Research Management. She teaches Introduction to Textiles, Textiles Laboratory, and Textile Evaluation. She earned her Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota and her M.S. from Colorado State Univeristy. Dr. Chen-Yu has received many accolades, including the Paper of Distinction award, Textile Science Track from the International Textiles & Apparel Association Annual Conference in 2010, 2012, and 2016, and the Excellence in Graduate Advising Award from the Virginia Tech College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences in 2016.</p>
