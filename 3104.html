     <h1>COMM 3104- Fashion Retailing Concepts</h1>
     <h2>Dr. Kincade</h2>
     <p>Fashion Retailing Concepts teaches merchandising mathematics and the basics of retail. This is a very interesting class because it teaches entrepreneurial information and the skills necessary to open a retail business.</p>
     <p>Dr. Kincade is a professor in the Department of Apparel, Housing, and Resource Management. She is also my academic advisor. She earned her B.S. and M.S.H.E. at East Carolina State University and her Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina. Dr. Kincade co-wrote the textbook we use in class. She has received two Recognition of Research awards in 2012 and 2013 and the Excellence in Research and Creative Scholarship Award from Virginia Tech's College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences in 2012.</p>
