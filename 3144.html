     <h2>Dr. Watkins</h2>
     <p> Writing and Editing for Public Relations is an incredibly important part of the PR curriculum. In this class, we learn how to create media kits, including news releases, story pitches, backgrounders, fact sheets, etc. These skills are essential to becoming independent PR practitioners in future internships and jobs.</p>
     <p>Dr. Watkins is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication. She earned her B.A. from Mississippi Univerity for Women and her M.A. and Ph.D. from The Univeristy of Alabama. Her teaching interests include social media, sports and public relations, and writing and editing for public relations.</p>
