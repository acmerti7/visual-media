     <h1>COMM 3224- Apparel Production</h1>
     <h2>Dr. Quesenberry</h2>
     <p>Apparel Production teaches the fundamentals of garment sewing. Most of our work is completed on sewing machines. The class begins with Dr. Quesenberry introducing us to different stitches, from simple to complex, using sample fabric pieces. By the end of the semester, we must have completed shorts, a skirt, and a shirt using pattern kits.</p>
     <p>Dr. Quesenberry is a Collegiate Assistant Professor in the Department of Apparel, Housing, and Resource Management. She attended New River Community College and went on to get her Ed.S. from Virginia Tech. She later earned her Ph.D. from Virginia Tech. She has over 16 years experience in the apparel production industry and has been with Virginia Tech for 31 years.</p>
